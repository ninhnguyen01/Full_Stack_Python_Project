# HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INTRODUCTION
<h2>Note: This markdown along with intro, ch2-10 files, and misc, unless otherwise specified, are from an old Python book (2021)</h2>
<p>If the code works for you, it demonstrates that basic Python code still works despite incremental future changes to a Python version.</p>

<h2> What is a program?</h2>
A set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
 
<h2> What is hardware?</h2>
All physical devices or compenents, of which a computer is made.

<h2> List the five major components of a computer system?</h2>
CPU, Main Memory (RAM), Secondary Storage Device, Input Devices, 
Output Devices.

<h2> What part of the computer actually runs programs?</h2>
 CPU

<h2> What part of the computer serves as a work area to store a program  
and its data while the program is running?</h2>
Main Memory

<h2> What part of the computer holds data for a long periods of time,  
even when there is no power to the computer?</h2>
Secondary Storage

<h2> What part of the computer collects data from people 
and other devices?</h2>
Input Device

<h2> What part of the computer formats and presents date for people  
or other devices?</h2>
Output Device

<h2> What fundamental set of programs control the internal operations  
of the computer's hardware?</h2>
Operating System

<h2> What do you call a program that performs a specialized task,  
such as a virus scanner, a file compression program, or a data backup 
program?</h2>
Utility Program.

<h2> Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, email programs,  
web browsers, and game programs belong to what category of software?</h2>
Application Software

# How Computers Store Data

<h2> What amount of memory is enough to store a letter of the alphabet 
or a small number?</h2>
Byte

<h2> What do you call a tiny "switch" that can be set to either on or 
off?</h2> 
Bit

<h2> In what numbering system are all numeric values written as 
sequences of 0s and 1s?</h2>
Binary Numbering System

<h2> What is the purpose of ASCII?</h2>
An encoding scheme that uses a set of 128 numeric codes 
to represent the English letters, various punctuation marks, 
and other characters. These numeric codes are used to store 
characters in a computer's memory.

<h2> What encoding scheme is extensive enough to represent the 
characters of many of the languages in the world?</h2>
Unicode

<h2> What do the terms "digital data" and "digital device" mean?</h2>
Digital data is any data that is stored in binary format and 
digital device is any device that works with binary data.

# How a Program Works

<h2> A CPU understands instructions that are written only in 
what language?</h2>
Machine Language

<h2> A program has to be copied into what type of memory each time 
the CPU excutes it?</h2>
Main Memory or RAM

<h2> When a CPU executes the instructions in a program, it is engaged 
in what process?</h2>
A fetch decode execute style.

<h2> What is assembly language?</h2>
An alternative to machine language that uses short words known as 
mnemonics.
   
<h2> What type of programming language allows you to create powerful 
and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works?</h2>
High Level Language

<h2> Each lanuguage has a set of rules that must be strictly followed 
when writing a program. What is this set of rules called?</h2>
Syntax

<h2> What do you call a program that translates a high level language 
program into a separate machine language program?</h2>
Compiler

<h2> What do you call a program that both translates and executes the 
instructions in a high level language program?</h2>
Interpreter

<h2> What type of mistake is usually caused by a misspelled keyword, a 
missing punctuation character, or the incorrect use of an operator?</h2>
Syntax Error
