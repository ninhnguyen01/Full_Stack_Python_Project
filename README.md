# Full Stack Python
<h1>What is full stack development?</h1>
<p>Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data. - AWS</p>
