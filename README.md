# Full Stack Python
<h1>What is full stack development?</h1>
<p>Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data. - AWS</p>

<h2>Python Checklist</h2>
<p>(1) Scripting (Python Fundamental)</p>
<p>(2) Data (Relational databases, ORM, NoSQL, Data Analysis, Data Viz)</p>
<p>(3) Web Development (Framework, Engines, Design, Task Queue, SSG, Testing, Networking, APIs, Security)</p>
<p>(4) Web App Deployment (Hosting, VPS, PaaS, OS, Servers, CI, CM, Containers, Architectures)</p>
<p>(5) DevOps (Monitoring, Performance)</p>
<p>(7) AI (LLM, RAG, MCP, Agents)</p>

<h2>Business Applications Example</h2>
<p>Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:</p>
<p>(1) Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications.</p>

<h2>Open Source Enterprise Example</h2>
<p>Python is widely used across large enterprise organizations but the code is often not put out as open source.</p>
<p>(1) Collab by the U.S. government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) agency is a corporate intranet and collaboration platform for large organizations. The project is currently running and in-use by thousands of CFPB employees.</p>
<p>(2) Pants is a build system for software projects with many distinct parts and built with many different programming languages as is often the case in large organizations.</p>
